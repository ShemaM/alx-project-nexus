## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Rationale

The technologies for Project Nexus were chosen to prioritize developer experience, scalability, and maintainability.

### Stack Overview

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19 | Server-side rendering, App Router |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4 | Utility-first CSS framework |
| **Backend/CMS** | Payload CMS 3.72 | Headless CMS with admin panel |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Relational database via Supabase |
| **Testing** | Playwright, Vitest | E2E and integration testing |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Automated testing and security scanning |
| **Security** | CodeQL, Dependabot | Static analysis and dependency updates |

### Why Payload CMS?

Payload was chosen as our content management system and application framework for several key reasons:

- **Code-First & TypeScript-Native:** Unlike traditional CMSs, Payload allows us to define our data structures directly in TypeScript code. This provides strong typing from the database to the frontend, reducing errors and improving developer productivity.
- **Extensible & Customizable:** It's built to be a developer-first platform. We can easily extend its core functionality, customize the admin UI with our own React components, and integrate it seamlessly into our Next.js application.
- **Self-Hosted & Scalable:** Being able to self-host gives us full control over our data and infrastructure. It runs as a standard Node.js application, which can be easily containerized and scaled.
- **Powerful Features Out-of-the-Box:** Payload provides a rich feature set, including a flexible field editor, authentication, file uploads, and a robust GraphQL API.

*Alternatives considered: Strapi, Contentful. Payload's deep React integration and code-first approach made it ideal.*

### Why Supabase?

Supabase serves as our backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform, primarily for its PostgreSQL database:

- **Open Source & PostgreSQL-Based:** Reliable, powerful SQL database with excellent documentation.
- **More than a Database:** Offers authentication, storage, and auto-generated APIs for future growth.
- **Excellent Developer Experience:** Clean dashboard, easy-to-use client libraries.

*Alternatives considered: AWS RDS, PlanetScale. Supabase offers better DX for rapid development.*
